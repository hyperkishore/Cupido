# Functional Gaps and Suggested Fixes

| Gap | Evidence | Suggested Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Demo-only data and no live backend | Demo mode forced on (`src/config/demo.ts:1`); Supabase client instantiated with empty URL/key (`src/services/supabase.service.ts:1`, `src/config/api.config.ts:3`). | Introduce environment-driven configuration, disable demo mode by default, and wire reflections, profiles, and matches to real Supabase tables. |
| Authentication flow bypassed | The main app mounts `AppStateProvider` instead of the Auth context, so onboarding screens never render (`App.tsx:144`, `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx:1`). | Restore an auth gate that checks session state before showing the tab navigator, and connect it to Supabase OTP/email flows. |
| Reflection “AI” is heuristics-based | Voice transcription returns a placeholder when no key is set (`src/components/ChatReflectionInterface.tsx:223`); follow-ups rely on keyword checks rather than AI responses (`src/components/ChatReflectionInterface.tsx:526`). | Move conversation logic into a service that calls OpenAI/Anthropic, handle errors gracefully, and persist prompts/responses server-side. |
| Matching relies on mock thresholds | Matches only generate after five local reflections and source entirely from sample data (`src/screens/PixelPerfectMatchesScreen.tsx:40`, `src/services/matchingService.ts:80`). | Replace the AsyncStorage implementation with real match queries, using stored personality traits and reflection embeddings once Supabase data is available. |
| Messages overlay is static | The modal prints hard-coded conversations with no data fetch (`src/screens/PixelPerfectMessagesScreen.tsx:15`). | Hook the overlay to a messaging service (Stream/Supabase real-time) and display actual threads or hide the entry point until messaging works. |
| Social connectors are cosmetic | LinkedIn/YouTube prompts only fire alerts (`src/screens/PixelPerfectHomeScreen.tsx:58`, `src/screens/PixelPerfectHomeScreen.tsx:92`). | Gate these CTAs behind real OAuth integrations or replace them with actionable setup tasks the app can honor today. |
| Design system conflicts | Design spec disallows emoji (`README.md:261`), yet tab icons, likes, and alerts use emoji hearts (`App.tsx:73`, `src/screens/PixelPerfectMatchesScreen.tsx:88`). | Swap emoji for typography or vector assets that align with the documented minimalist guidelines. |
