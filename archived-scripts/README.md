# Archived Shell Scripts

## Archive Date: 2025-10-20

These scripts have been consolidated into the unified health check system and are no longer actively used. They have been preserved here for reference and potential future use.

## Consolidated Into:

### `system-health.sh` (Consolidates):
- `health-check.sh` - Core system validation
- `continuous-monitor.sh` - 24/7 monitoring capabilities  
- `error-management-control.sh` - Error management system

### `development-health.sh` (Consolidates):
- `dev-server.sh` - Development server management
- `debug-browser-reality.sh` - Browser state debugging
- `validate-js-syntax.sh` - JavaScript validation
- `debug-dashboard.sh` - Dashboard debugging

### `testing-health.sh` (Consolidates):
- `test-automation.sh` - Automation testing
- `test-dashboard-fix.sh` - Dashboard validation
- `validate-dashboard-fix.sh` - Validation testing
- `auto-test-reflect.sh` - UI testing automation
- `scripts/run-automated-tests.sh` - Automated test runner

### Additional Archived Scripts:
- `setup-context-automation.sh` - Context automation setup
- `install-claude-hooks.sh` - Claude Code hooks installer
- `version-control.sh` - Version control management
- `deploy.sh` - Deployment script

## Reason for Archival:
**CORRECTION**: Initial archival was overly aggressive. These scripts were archived thinking they had redundancy, but they actually serve distinct purposes beyond health checking. Many have been restored to active use.

## Status Update (2025-10-20):
**RESTORED TO ACTIVE USE:**
- `deploy.sh` - Essential for production deployment
- `version-control.sh` - Critical App.tsx backup/restore system  
- `install-claude-hooks.sh` - Claude Code integration for seamless workflow
- `setup-context-automation.sh` - Development automation setup
- `continuous-monitor.sh` - 24/7 production monitoring (different from on-demand health checks)
- `debug-browser-reality.sh` - Advanced browser debugging beyond basic health
- `auto-test-reflect.sh` - UI automation testing capabilities
- `dev-server.sh` - Enhanced development server with coordination

**REMAINING ARCHIVED:**
- Scripts that were truly redundant or have been fully consolidated into health scripts

## Lesson Learned:
Consolidation should preserve unique functionality, not eliminate it. Health checking and specialized tooling serve different purposes.
